**Blaze**, is a tool built to automate development, with blaze, you can open multiple softwares at once, terminals (powershell, cmd), you can also open multiple chrome tabs also. With blaze, you can open multiple softwares with a single click by launching the software. Blaze was and will be one of my favourite app on the windows OS.

## About Blaze ü§î

I built Blaze about **2 years** ago when I was still using my Elder sis PC to write codes, then my primary language was **PHP**. It was quite fustrating to open **VsCode, Chrome tabs, Xampp or Wampp Server** and other softwares I use for development. So I thought of a way to automate the process of opening all these softwares at once, then I came up with Blaze. Blaze was built with **PHP** and **Batch Script**. Blaze was built to help developers and non developers to open multiple softwares at once.

## Technologies üñ•Ô∏è

1. PHP (Frontend & Backend)
2. Bootstrap & CSS
3. Batch Script
4. Jquery
5. SweetAlert2
6. ThreeDots Loader
7. Animate CSS
8. Ajax (For form submission and API Request)

## How It Works üß†

Although, if I were to build something like this now, I wouldn't use this approach because I've learned a lot between when I build **Blaze** and now. Blaze works by collecting the user preference though a form, then the form data is sent to the server, the server then process the data and save it to a **Batch File**. The batch file is downloaded with a **Blaze.exe** together in a `.zip` file, after unzipping there is a **Blaze.exe** that once executed, it will run the **Blaze.bat** script, which will open the softwares and open the chrome tabs as specified by the user or any other configurations the user entered when filling the form.
